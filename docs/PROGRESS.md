# Progress log

Running log of what exists, what works, what failed and what is next. Newest
entry last. Design and hypotheses: `docs/proposal.md` (revised 1 Nov 2026).

## 2026-11-01: audit after the 1 Nov redesign

Context: the previous Claude Code session was lost. `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/proposal.md` were replaced with the 1 Nov versions from the user's
Downloads folder (the previous working-tree copies are not in git; the
committed versions are in 5fc8f5a). Everything below was checked today, not
copied from the old `CLAUDE.md`.

### Git state
- One commit on branch `week1` (5fc8f5a, 28 Oct): TQUIC submodule at stock
  v1.6.0 (d87a9a0), testbed scripts, Week 1 transfer runs.
- Not committed (left as is, nothing deleted): work from the old design
  (28-31 Oct, deadline scheduler and ML predictor):
  - 787 staged renames `results/<scenario>/...` ->
    `results/week1_transfer/<scenario>/...`, plus edits to `testbed/up.sh`,
    `testbed/run_transfer.sh`, `testbed/README.md`, `.gitignore`;
  - untracked: `streamer/` (mpq_sender/mpq_receiver, ~690 lines),
    `analysis/{frames,compare,plots,report_numbers}.py`, `analysis/ml/`,
    `testbed/{replay,replay_spec,train_spec}.py`, `testbed/run_stream.sh`,
    `docs/report/`, `docs/slides/`, three status PDFs, 1.1 GB in `results/`
    (old-design matrices, ML training data);
  - TQUIC submodule checked out at branch `team7` (10b826e), 9 commits above
    v1.6.0: frame_path log hook, ECF, deadline/framepin/learned schedulers,
    ML model, and a fix for a `select_send_path` stall when a path being
    validated has a full cwnd (5a82889). The parent repo still records d87a9a0.
- None of the old results answer the new hypotheses (different scenarios,
  workload, encodings, metrics); they are not evidence for H1-H5.

### Environment (checked 1 Nov)
| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel | 6.18.54.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2, Ubuntu 24.04.4 |
| sch_netem, sch_tbf, sch_htb | modules (`=m`); load with `modprobe -a ...`. Plain `modprobe sch_netem sch_tbf sch_htb` loads only netem (the rest are taken as module parameters); `testbed/up.sh` already uses `-a` |
| sudo | passwordless for `/usr/bin/ip`, `/usr/sbin/tc`, `/usr/sbin/modprobe` (works); `sudo -n true` needs a password (not needed) |
| Rust | cargo/rustc 1.99.1 |
| ffmpeg/ffprobe | 6.1.1 (libx264) |
| iperf3 | 3.16 |
| Python | 3.12.3; venv created at `analysis/.venv` with pandas 3.0.1, matplotlib 3.10.8, scipy 1.17.1 |

### Week 1 checklist (CLAUDE.md "Plan and gates")
| Item | Status | Evidence / gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TQUIC builds, tests pass | done for `team7` (10b826e) | `cargo build --release --all` ok; `cargo test --release`: 566 + 1 passed, 0 failed (1 Nov). Stock v1.6.0 passed 552/552 on 28 Oct (commit 5fc8f5a message) |
| `testbed/up.sh` / `down.sh` | works, old presets | up, rerun and down all clean; ping 40.1 ms min on both paths for a 40 ms preset. Presets are the old ones (4 Mbit/s, 100 ms queue); new scenarios (control, symmetric 1.6+1.6, rtt_asym 1.6+1.6 @30/150, bw_asym, outage) and the 200 ms buffer are missing |
| Calibration report | missing | `testbed/check.sh` reports mean rate (5 s TCP iperf3) and mean ping only; no 100 ms bins vs trace, no report |
| Multipath transfer, both paths, MinRTT and round-robin | done under old presets | `results/week1_transfer/`: symmetric and rtt_asym (4 Mbit/s paths), both paths 48-52% of bytes, 1 of 62 transfers stalled (rtt_asym/roundrobin). Not repeated on the new scenarios |
| `docs/trace_collection.md` | missing | `traces/collect/README.md` + `iperf3_to_csv.py` exist (old, downlink `-R`, 5 min, no ping, no VM setup) |
| Encode main clip, both modes | missing | No NPTEL clip chosen or downloaded; `workload/make_frame_trace.sh` does CRF + 2 s GOP only (no CBR, no intra-refresh) |
| First trace site | not started | needs phones and a cloud VM (teammates) |

### Next
Week 1 plan to be agreed with the user (see chat on 1 Nov).

## 2026-11-01: Gate A (TQUIC builds, tests pass): passed

Done
- Old-design work archived, nothing deleted:
  - code and docs: branch `archive/old-design` (6da75fb) in this repo;
  - results (1.1 GB), old binaries, old encodes and the old streamer build:
    moved to `~/acn-archive/` (outside the repo). `results/` in the repo is
    empty; the 28 Oct transfer runs remain in git history (5fc8f5a).
  - TQUIC: old branch renamed `team7-old` (10b826e).
- New TQUIC branch `team7`, base **d87a9a0** (tag v1.6.0, "Merge pull request
  #438 from Tencent/release/v1.6.0"), two commits:
  - 108bc38 stall fix in `select_send_path` + unit test;
  - c51c237 `tquic::frame_path` debug log of every sent STREAM frame with its
    path id (logging only; off unless that log target is enabled).
- CLAUDE.md: `modprobe -a` (approved by the user).

Evidence
- `cargo build --release --all`: ok. `cargo test --release` and `cargo test`
  (debug): 552 + 1 passed, 0 failed.
- New test `conn_multipath_probing_path_cwnd_full` on stock v1.6.0 code:
  **fails** (`assertion failed: !packets.is_empty()`: the client sends no
  packet at all); with the fix: passes.

The stall fix, and how it relates to hook b
- Bug (v1.6.0, connection.rs `select_send_path`, first block): once the
  connection is established, any path that needs PATH_CHALLENGE/RESPONSE is
  returned first, without checking its congestion window. `send_packet` checks
  the window before it writes validation frames, so if that path's window is
  full the packet is empty and `send()` returns Done. The next `send()` picks
  the same path again, so nothing (stream data, ACKs) leaves on any path until
  that path's window opens, which needs ACKs that are not being sent. Seen in
  the old design on trace replay with path B near 8 kbit/s during validation.
- Fix: such a path is skipped while `recovery.can_send()` is false; selection
  falls through to the normal multipath branch (scheduler, then ACK/PTO path,
  then active path). Validation frames go out as soon as the window opens (the
  test checks this too).
- Effect on schedulers: identical for all of them; it only matters during path
  validation, before the second path becomes active, so it cannot favour any
  scheduler. Without it, a transfer could stall for reasons unrelated to the
  scheduler under test.
- Hook b (declined-send flag, not built yet) acts in a different place: after
  `on_select` declines, the fallback to the ACK/PTO path or the active path must
  not carry stream data. The fix changes only the probing block that runs
  before `on_select`. The two cannot conflict: when the fix skips a probing
  path, control reaches `on_select`, and if that declines, hook b applies as
  designed. Hook b blocks stream data only, so PATH_CHALLENGE/RESPONSE on a
  fallback path stays allowed. Hook b's unit tests (week 2) will rerun
  `conn_multipath_probing_path_cwnd_full`.

Next: Gate B (scenario presets, 200 ms buffer, outage and trace replay).

## 2026-11-01: Gate B (scenario presets, replay): passed

Done
- `testbed/up.sh`: scenarios control, symmetric, rtt_asym, bw_asym, outage,
  real_pairs (proposal section 4), buffer 200 ms of each path's rate.
- `testbed/replay.py` (adapted from the archived one): outage schedule and
  trace replay; logs each device's starting rate and every change.
- `testbed/trace_site.py` + site format `traces/<site>/site.json` and csv
  `t_ms,mbps,capped,loaded_rtt_ms` (CLAUDE.md's layout line says `t_ms, mbps,
  rtt_ms`; the RTT is now split into unloaded (site.json, used as the replay
  delay) and loaded (csv, reference only), as the user specified on 1 Nov).
- `traces/public_mahimahi/`: two public Mahimahi uplink traces (AT&T LTE,
  T-Mobile UMTS) as a calibration fixture only; their RTTs (40/60 ms) are
  configured, not measured. Not evidence for any hypothesis.

Evidence
- Every scenario comes up; `tc` shows the configured netem delay (RTT/2) and
  tbf rate on each veth end. State file records scenario, site, rates, RTTs.
- Outage schedule computed over 64 s: drops start at 15 s (A), 30 s (B),
  45 s (A), 60 s (B), each lasting 2.0 s. A 3 s replay from offset 14.5 s set
  cA and sA to 8 kbit at t = 500 ms and back to 1800 kbit at t = 2500 ms.
- real_pairs replay from offset 60 s applied the trace bin by bin (cA:
  1560, 1200, ... kbit, matching rows 601-621 of the trace); cB went to
  8 kbit (a zero bin, clamped to the tbf minimum).

Interpretation choices (not hypotheses; flagged to the user)
- Outage "each path in turn at 0 for 2 s every 15 s": implemented as one
  outage every 15 s, alternating A, B, A, ... (each path once per 30 s), both
  directions, "0" = 8 kbit/s (tbf minimum; about one 1500-byte packet per
  1.5 s).
- real_pairs: traces shape the data direction (client -> server); the reverse
  direction (ACKs) stays at the trace mean; buffer bytes fixed at 200 ms of the
  trace mean.

Next: Gate C (calibration report).

## 2026-11-01: Gate C (calibration report): passed

Done
- `testbed/calibrate.sh` (unloaded ping, iperf3 UDP above capacity with
  100 ms receiver bins, loaded ping) and `analysis/calibration.py`.
- `docs/calibration.md`: method, results, what failed first.
- Shaper changed twice because calibration caught errors:
  1. tbf -> htb: tbf refills its bucket on every `tc change`, so trace replay
     delivered 9-25% too much (1 s medians). Also affects the archived old
     design's trace results.
  2. 8 kbit/s "zero" -> plug block: htb's time-based token debt stalled paths
     for up to ~1.2 s after zero bins.

Evidence (final shaper, runs in `results/calibration/`)
- Unloaded RTT: median 0.0-0.4 ms above configured on every path.
- Static rates: mean within 0.2%; 1 s windows within 0.6%.
- Outage: zero-rate bins measure 0; mean within 0.1%.
- Trace replay (public Mahimahi uplink, 3 offsets): mean within 1.5%; 1 s
  windows within about 3% except on near-zero stretches of trace B (p95 +10.9%
  and +19.5%, few packets per second).
- Buffer: loaded RTT = configured RTT + 199-200 ms on four paths.

Failed / excluded runs
- real_pairs_public_mahimahi/7: path-B iperf3 client lost its TCP control
  connection (trace B mostly zero at offset 0); script aborted before
  meta.env; not analysed. Run 10 repeated it (same client error, server log
  complete, used).
- symmetric/1: taken before calibrate.sh had run ids and tc stats (moved into
  `symmetric/1` by me; files unchanged; I briefly appended a note to its
  meta.env and removed it again).
- tbf runs (symmetric/1-2, control/1, rtt_asym/1, bw_asym/1, outage/1,
  real_pairs/1-3) and first htb runs (symmetric/3, */2, real_pairs/4-6) are
  kept as evidence for the shaper changes; not used as calibration.
- The tbf runs record REPO_GIT=c9fadae although calibrate.sh was not yet
  committed (the dirty check covered tracked files only).

Next: Gate D (multipath transfers on the new scenarios, CUBIC).

## 2026-11-01: Gate D (multipath transfer, both paths, MinRTT and RR): passed

TQUIC multipath works; no picoquic fallback needed.

Evidence (`results/week1_transfer/{symmetric,rtt_asym}/{minrtt,roundrobin}-cubic/1-5`,
TQUIC c51c237, CUBIC, 10 MiB download)
- 20 of 20 transfers complete, file identical, 0 stalled.
- Both paths carry 49.3-50.7% of the bytes in every run (veth counters).
- Goodput 2.85-2.94 Mbit/s of 3.2 Mbit/s combined; table in
  `testbed/README.md`.
- Direction: download (server sends), as in TQUIC's tools; the static
  scenarios shape both directions alike. The streamer (week 2) sends client
  -> server.

## 2026-11-01: trace kit (`docs/trace_collection.md`): written

- `docs/trace_collection.md` for teammates: VM setup (iperf3 on 5201/5202,
  firewall incl. ICMP), Termux setup, UDP reachability check, recording
  command (30 s idle ping, 600 s UDP 15 Mbit/s 1200 B with ping alongside,
  30 s idle ping), site log template, hand-off.
- `traces/collect/vm_server.sh` (VM: one iperf3 server per phone, 100 ms bins,
  first-packet time on the VM clock) and `traces/collect/make_site.py`
  (raw files -> `traces/<site>/a.csv, b.csv, site.json`; capped flag = bin
  within 5% of the offered rate; unloaded RTT = median of idle pings; loaded
  RTT per bin for reference).
- make_site.py checked end to end on the testbed (server namespace standing in
  for the VM, bw_asym): IP-level rates 1.97 / 1.18 Mbit/s for 2000 / 1200
  kbit/s wire, unloaded RTT 40.3 / 60.3 ms, loaded 240 / 263 ms; capped flag
  99% when the offered rate was set at capacity. The test site was deleted.
  vm_server.sh not run here (needs tcpdump, not installed in WSL); its syntax
  was checked only.
- Not verified: Termux/Android `ping -D` output format and minimum interval;
  the guide tells teammates to check `ping -D` first.

## 2026-11-01: encodings (Week 1 item 6): done, main clip to be chosen

Done
- `workload/clips.csv` (3 blackboard candidates, 2 controls), `download.sh`,
  `pick_start.sh`, `encode.sh` (intra / gop2), `frame_stats.py`, README with
  the frame-size table. Frame traces and `.cmd.txt` (exact command, x264
  option string) committed; videos are git-ignored.
- Encodes checked: x264 options in the stream show rc=cbr, bitrate=2600,
  vbv_maxrate=2600, vbv_bufsize=1300, bframes=0, rc_lookahead=0, keyint=50,
  scenecut=0, intra_refresh=1 (intra), nal_hrd=none, filler=0. Intra mode has
  exactly one I-frame (frame 0) in every clip.

Problems found and fixed
- First intra encodes had a scene-cut I-frame (stochastic, handwriting):
  x264 still inserts them with intra refresh; now scenecut=0.
- encode.sh's inline Python failed on escaped quotes; replaced by awk.
- Slides control: the median-complexity window (2440 s) was tablet writing;
  now 3050 s, picked by the same rule within the slides-only stretch.

For the user to decide / note
- Main clip: stochastic, linalg or probability (table in workload/README.md).
- License: the YouTube pages say CC BY; NPTEL's policy is CC BY-SA since Sep
  2014 (CC wiki). No page found that states CC BY-NC-SA, as CLAUDE.md says.
- Frame rate: sources are 25 fps; encoded at 25, not the proposal's 30.
- No CBR filler; controls average well below 2.6 Mbit/s.
- Camera cuts make large P-frames even in intra-refresh mode (relevant to H5).

Week 1 status: all gate items done except the first trace site (teammates).
Open: choose main clip; record traces; CLAUDE.md "Main clip" line (license,
fps) once the user decides.

## 2026-11-01: user decisions on clip, licence, fps, outage

Decided by the user (1 Nov):
- Main clip `stochastic`; `linalg` added to the content-control cell (S0, S1,
  F2, R1 x rtt_asym x 8) to show results do not depend on the camera cut.
  Windows were fixed by the median-size rule before any scheduler run
  (recorded in workload/README.md, with an attribution list).
- Licence: CC BY-SA (NPTEL since Sep 2014) in CLAUDE.md and proposal.
- 25 fps accepted: proposal now says frame interval 40 ms; the freeze rule is
  unchanged, which at 25 fps gives a 190 ms threshold.
- Outage reading confirmed: alternate A, B, A, ... every 15 s.
- Budget: content controls 3 contents x 4 configs x 8 = 96 runs (was 64);
  total ~1,240 runs.
Edited by me at the user's request: docs/proposal.md (licence, fps, freeze
threshold at 25 fps, controls, budget) and CLAUDE.md (same). Hypotheses
H1-H5, thresholds and P1-P6 untouched. The claude.ai copy of the proposal
(linked at its top) was not updated.

## 2026-11-01: week 2, TQUIC hooks a-c and ECF: done

TQUIC `team7` now (on d87a9a0 = v1.6.0): 108bc38 stall fix, c51c237
frame_path log, a218a69 hooks a+b, 6024ae7 hook c, a98f01d ECF.
`cargo test --release`: 563 + 1 passed.

CLAUDE.md "TQUIC facts" checked in source (1 Nov): 1 (global stream queue),
2 (fallback writes stream data after a declined on_select), 3 (urgency 127,
incremental), 4 (app_limited=false to on_ack; CUBIC pacing from cwnd),
5 (persistent congestion stub) all hold; line numbers have shifted.

- Hook a, `Connection::stream_set_path_preference(stream_id, Some((local,
  remote)))`: packets for another active path skip the stream; it is put
  back in the queue afterwards. A preference for an inactive path is
  ignored. Note for F1/F2: the scheduler must also pick the preferred path,
  or the data waits (a path-unaware scheduler can starve such streams).
- Hook b: after a declined on_select the fallback packet carries no stream
  data, except PTO probes. Built-in schedulers decline only when no active
  path can send, so they behave as before (their fallback could only send
  stream data in probes, which stay allowed).
- Hook c: fact 4 confirmed by a test (cwnd 13472 -> 40162 bytes while bytes
  in flight stayed under a quarter of the window), so the RFC 9002 7.8 rule
  is applied for every scheduler: an ACK is application-limited unless bytes
  in flight before it were >= half the window or within 3 packets of it.
  A second test checks that a window-limited sender still grows. The first
  version of that test was wrong (the test config's 90-byte flow-control
  window kept the sender below the window); fixed by raising the
  receiver's limits.
- Each hook test fails with its hook disabled (checked), except the
  inactive-path test, which covers the "ignore" case.
- ECF ported from team7-old (6 unit tests).

Not yet checked: bulk transfer goodput on the testbed with hook c (unit
test only). The streamer runs will show it.

## 2026-11-01: week 2, streamer, run script, analysis: done; S0-S4 batch started

Done
- `streamer/` rewritten for the new design, reusing the archived event loops
  and logger: sender = QUIC client (lecturer side, adds one path per local
  address), receiver = QUIC server. Each frame part is a stream with a
  16-byte header {frame_id, offset, length, frame_size}; the receiver
  completes a frame when the union of received ranges covers it. Streams are
  non-incremental at one urgency (strict frame order). Unit tests: header,
  range reassembly (out of order, rescue overlap, duplicates), clip rotation.
- TQUIC f60aecc: frame_path log line also gives the path's local address
  (path ids are internal; logging only).
- `scripts/run.sh <scenario> <config> <bitrate> <encoding> <clip> <run_id>`:
  S0 (single best path), S1 minrtt, S2 roundrobin, S3 redundant, S4 ecf;
  clip offset (multiple of 50 frames) and trace/outage offset from a seed per
  run_id (paired); frames.csv in the CLAUDE.md format, paths.csv, cpu.csv,
  meta.json (git hashes, binary hashes, offsets, exits, CPU max, veth bytes,
  stalled flag). Exit 3 = stalled, 4 = CPU > 80%.
- `scripts/batch.sh`: fixed binary snapshot, run_id-major order, resume,
  CPU-rule rerun (discarded runs moved to results/_discarded/), log.
- `analysis/playout.py` (+ 11 hand-computed tests; my first expected values
  for one case were wrong, the code was right: under intra refresh frame 9
  depends on frames 4-5), `analysis/summarize.py` (one row per run).

Evidence
- Dev runs (run_id 0, not part of any analysis): symmetric/S1 and
  rtt_asym/S0-S4: all 1500 frames complete; CPU max 12-28%; per-path stream
  bytes match veth counters within protocol overhead.

Batch `week2_s0s4` (started 1 Nov evening): SCENARIOS control symmetric
rtt_asym bw_asym outage x CONFIGS S0-S4 x RUN_IDS 1-8, 2600 kbit/s, intra,
stochastic. Log: results/batches/week2_s0s4.log. Expected ~4-5 h.

## 2026-11-01 evening: first S0-S4 batch stopped; two bugs fixed; batch restarted

The first batch (`week2_s0s4`, build 40d0216 / TQUIC f60aecc) was stopped
after 23 runs. Its runs are invalid and were moved, unchanged, to
`results/_superseded/week2_s0s4_build40d0216/` (with its log); not analysed.

1. Sender bug (mine): `stream_write` returns Done when the connection has no
   send capacity (here: during a 2 s outage); the sender treated it as fatal
   and exited ("Error: Done"; outage/S0/1 completed 165 of 1500 frames).
   Now Done = nothing written, the frame waits for on_stream_writable.
   build_frames.py now skips (and counts) a log line cut short by a crash.
2. Hook c bug (mine, TQUIC 4d7481d): CUBIC's on_ack returned before updating
   pacing_rate = cwnd/srtt on application-limited ACKs. After an outage the
   rate set while srtt was ~2 s stayed frozen (0.21 Mbit/s while cwnd was
   47 KB and srtt back to 45 ms), the sender stayed pacing-limited, every ACK
   looked application-limited, and the path never recovered (outage dev run
   0: 717 of 1500 frames). RFC 9002 7.8 only forbids window growth; pacing is
   now refreshed. New test cubic_app_limited_ack_updates_pacing_only fails
   without the fix. This could also slow non-outage runs whenever srtt rose,
   which is why every run of the first batch is discarded, not just outage.
   After both fixes: outage dev runs 91 (S0, S1) complete 1500/1500.
TQUIC suite: 564 + 1 pass.

Batch `week2_s0s4_v2` started with the fixed build (same cells, run ids 1-8).
Dev runs (run_id 0 and 91) remain under results/ and are never analysed.
